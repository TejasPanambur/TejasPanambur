## About Me

I’m an AI Research Scientist and Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UMass Amherst, specializing in machine learning, computer vision, and self-supervised learning. My research focuses on advanced clustering, representation learning, and multimodal AI, supporting NASA’s Mars mission analysis and other high-impact AI projects. I've worked with SETI and Nokia Bell Labs on cutting-edge AI models as a research intern for planetary exploration and industry applications.

## Highlights

- **5+ Publications** in AI/ML research (CVPR, IGARSS) on clustering, texture recognition, and multimodal learning.
- **NASA/SETI Collaboration**: Developed transformer models for planetary imagery and spectral analysis.
- **Nokia Bell Labs**: Enhanced model efficiency with active learning strategies.
- **Skills**: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, deep clustering, and generative models.
- **Key Projects**: Self-supervised classification of Martian terrain; multimodal foundation model for spectral data.
- **Teaching**: TA for courses in data structures, algorithms, and advanced programming.
